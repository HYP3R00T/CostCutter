This page lists all AWS services and resource types that CostCutter can delete or manage directly.

| Service                                  | Resource Type | Notes |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| _(Add entries as you implement support)_ |               |       |

_Keep this table updated as new services/resources are added to CostCutter._
