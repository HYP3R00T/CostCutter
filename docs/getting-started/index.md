## What You'll Need

- **A Safe Environment** - Test in sandbox/dev accounts only

## Quick Links

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Installation](installation.md) | Install via uvx, pip, or in a virtual environment |
| [Quick Start](quickstart.md) | Run your first dry-run in 2 minutes |

## Recommended Flow

```
1. Install  ->  2. Configure AWS  ->  3. Dry-Run  ->  4. Review  ->  5. Execute

!!! warning "Safety First"
    Always run `--dry-run` first to preview what would be deleted. CostCutter **permanently deletes resources** and this cannot be undone.
